Every time I leave and come back, I feel like a stranger. I feel different and changed. Every place shows you something new, gives you unexpected feelings and a remarkable sign that somehow made a little new part of you. Who you are, the person you have become. It is all about what our eyes have seen and what our heart has felt. It is about the encounters and the traditions of each place. It is about the situations. When you were struggling abroad alone and you were just thinking about giving up, you actually didn’t know that all that struggle was making you the strong and independent woman you are. When you decided to travel the world, you didn’t know it would have been so hard to come back. To see the differences of the world and to see how some people just decide to be blind and not with their eyes, but with their mind. It is crazy how people who can’t do things because of disabilities, they just wish they could just see, feel or hear. And people who have no restrictions, decide to accept and keep being blind in front of a world that is so worth to be seen. I am thankful to be able to speak, hear, see and move. I am thankful to be a person that wants to explore. I am thankful that I can see what the world has to offer. Don’t be afraid to see the world. Don’t be afraid to make a radical change. Be scared of the routine. Be scared of the ‘same’, the ‘usual’, the ‘ordinary’, the ‘everyday’. Look for the ‘new’, the ‘varieties’, the ‘different’, the ‘rare’. Look for your happiness and don’t pretend to be something you are not.
