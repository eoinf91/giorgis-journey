# Hello<span class='blue'>,</span> <br />I'm Giorgi

I created Giorgis Journey with the hope to bring you with me along my journeys. 

The posts are all written exclusively by me, Giorgi, with the will to inspire other girls like me to travel the world. 

You can read more about me and my idea of wandering around the globe [‘here’](/about).

And don’t forget to join me on social media to follow my steps and travel with me!
