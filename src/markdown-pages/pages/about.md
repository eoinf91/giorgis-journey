# <span class='blue'>About</span> <br /> Giorgi's Journey

I am Giorgia, but everybody calls me Giorgi. I am from Como, in the North of Italy. I have attended a school of art and have always been very creative. At the age of 18, I decided to move abroad as an au pair and I chose Ireland as my destination. The plan was to be with my host family for ten months, but I ended up staying in Ireland for six years. I worked as barista and supervisor and traveled around Ireland, from Connemara to the Aran Islands. I also managed to save some money and traveled around Europe too. I went to Amsterdam, Norway, Iceland, Denmark, and Sweden. Living in Ireland made me understand that I needed to just go. No matter where, I just needed to go explore. Since then, I never left my desire of wandering behind.
